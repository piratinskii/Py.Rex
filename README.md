# Py.Rex

#### About the project

This project is a simple console implementation of the Google Chrome Dinosaur game. It is intentionally written with minimal use of external frameworks and libraries, keeping it as straightforward as possible. All graphics are directly displayed in the console as characters and are redrawn with each frame change. All objects in the game are also character-based, without using complex graphics. The difficulty level gradually increases after the game starts, with cacti appearing more frequently. The game's environment (the starry sky and the moon) is randomly generated, so the sky will be different each time you launch the game. You can run this program even on a server with minimal available resources (though I don't recommend doing that; it's just a joke).
